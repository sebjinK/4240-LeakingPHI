# AI Health Habit Tracker
*A Conversational Assistant for Personal Wellness Monitoring*

## Project Overview
The **AI Health Habit Tracker** is a text-based AI wellness assistant designed to help users build and maintain healthy daily routines. It provides a simple, conversational way to log sleep, exercise, meals, hydration, and mood — without requiring complex wearables or manual app navigation.

By leveraging natural language input, users can type sentences like  
> “I slept 7 hours and went to the gym for 45 minutes”  
and the assistant will automatically extract, store, and analyze this data to provide meaningful feedback and motivation.

## Motivation
Maintaining consistent health habits such as **sleep**, **exercise**, **hydration**, and **nutrition** can be challenging without feedback or accountability.  
Many students and professionals struggle to keep track of these habits effectively, while existing fitness apps often depend on:
- Time-consuming manual data entry  
- Expensive wearable devices  

This project seeks to bridge that gap by providing a **lightweight, text-driven AI assistant** that encourages consistent wellness tracking through friendly and intelligent conversation.

   - Users can log health behaviors through natural text (e.g., sleep hours, workouts, meals, hydration, mood).  
2. **Personalized Setup**
   - Collects basic user info such as weight, height, activity level, and hydration habits.
3. **Smart Summaries**
   - Generates concise summaries of logged behaviors and patterns.
4. **Natural Language Parsing**
   - Understands everyday phrases using NLP, e.g., “I drank three bottles of water today.”
5. **Data Storage**
   - Saves parsed data to a **lightweight database** or **Google Sheets** for persistence.
6. **Personalized Feedback**
   - Provides encouraging and adaptive messages like:  
     > “You’ve been averaging 6 hours of sleep this week; try aiming for 7+!”  
7. *(Optional)* Future integration with wearable or voice-based devices.

## Example Interaction
**User:** “I slept 6 hours, ran for 30 minutes, and drank 2 bottles of water.”  
**Assistant:**  
> “Got it! You’ve logged 6 hours of sleep and 30 minutes of exercise. You’re doing great! Don’t forget to stay hydrated — you’re two bottles away from your daily goal.”
